# Flight Training - Airfield VFR Comms Gouge

The comms in this guide are adapted from those used by NATO nations in military aircraft operations.

Your callsign in all communications to ATC should be your squadron- or flight-assigned ATC callsign, such as "Dragon 11". I will use that example as a generic placeholder for the purposes of this guide.

*In this guide, any comms in parentheses ( ) are optional information and should be stated if you know it.*

### Startup

Dragon 11: *"Dragon 11, start (on Alpha)"*
<br>
ATC: *"Dragon 11, cleared start"*

"On Alpha" there is the name of the parking area (ramp) you're on. If you don't know it, you can leave it out, but do say it if you know it; it makes the ground controller's job easier.

How about a formation?

When in a formation, the flight should always check in on engine start and on any frequency change.

Enfield 1 (on intra-flight): *"Enfield check"* or often, just *"Enfield"*
<br>
Enfield 2: *"2"*
<br>
Enfield 3: *"3"*
<br>
Enfield 4: *"4"*
<br>
Enfield 1 (on ground): *"Incirlik Ground, Enfield flight as fragged for start (on Alpha)"*

"As fragged" is the number of jets in the formation as published in the details your squadron or command has given to ATC; the phrase is used so that the enemy doesn't know how many of you there are. If you're missing a jet on start because it's unserviceable and you have to fly as a 3-ship, then it's "as fragged minus 1".

If you are away at an airfield that may not have your ATO details - and therefore won't understand "as fragged" - you'd say "flight of 4" (or however many aircraft are in your flight) instead. This is also how civilian formation comms calls would be made.

**Common Comms Crime:** DickPilot: *"DickPilot, starting up at Incirlik with 3 souls aboard, looking to route outbound via the coast and then come left towards the mountains for some winch training. We'll be about 45 minutes and then we'll look to recover for some instrument approaches."* Don't be that guy. You know, the kind of guy who flies helicopters. The goal in all comms should be to say as few words a possible. Something to keep in mind!

### Taxi (Departure)

Dragon 11: *"Incirlik Ground, Dragon 11, taxi (with Kilo)"*
<br>
ATC: *"Dragon 11, taxi runway 23 via Alpha, Golf, Echo"*
<br>
Dragon 11: *"Alpha, Golf, Echo to 23, Dragon 11"*

You can also say "negative ATIS" and ATC should give you the current runway, wind, and QNH* altimeter setting... But don't do this if ATIS is available. It will make ATC hate you. You don't want them to hate you.

Dragon 11: *"Incirlik Ground, Dragon 11, taxi, negative ATIS"*
<br>
ATC: *"Dragon 11, information Kilo, runway 23, wind 220 at 10, altimeter 2928, taxi runway 23 via Alpha, Golf, Echo"*
<br>
Dragon 11: *"Information Kilo; Alpha, Golf, Echo to 23, Dragon 11"**

**Russia, the UK, and a few other nations use QFE instead of QNH for airfield ops, and so you may be given QFE instead. QFE is especially appropriate when staying within an aerodrome area, and where the airfield elevation is below 3000ft MSL with no surrounding high-elevation terrain features; QNH shall be used for all flights outside of a terminal area, however.*

**Common Comms Crime:** DickPilot: *"DickPilot, looking to taxi to the active"* OBVIOUSLY! ARRGH!

### Take-Off

**When cleared for take-off, aircraft are expected to depart without delay. If a delay is anticipated, tower should be notified immediately.**

Note: the word "take-off" is NEVER used by ATC unless you are actually being cleared to take-off. If you're VFR, you may want to tell the controller which cardinal or sub-cardinal direction you wish to depart the area towards; this will help them manage the flow of traffic through their airspace. Otherwise, simply say "VFR".

Dragon 11: *"Incirlik Tower, Dragon 11, take-off, VFR"*
<br>
ATC: *"Dragon 11, runway 23, cleared for take-off"*
<br>
Dragon 11: *"Cleared for take-off, Dragon 11"*

Depending on traffic, ATC may provide you instructions to follow after departure, even as a VFR flight. **As with all directives from ATC, you must read these instructions back.**

Dragon 11: *"Incirlik Tower, Dragon 11, take-off, VFR (to the North-East)"*
<br>
ATC: *"Dragon 11, fly runway heading 2 miles, make right traffic, depart from downwind, runway 23, cleared for take-off"*
<br>
Dragon 11: *"Straight out 2 miles, right traffic, depart downwind, cleared for take-off, Dragon 11"*

Instructions THAT long would be rather uncommon, thankfully!

If the wind has shifted significantly but the ATIS has yet to be updated, or at the controller's discretion, they may add the current wind to the clearance.

Dragon 11: *"Incirlik Tower, Dragon 11, take-off, VFR"*
<br>
ATC: *"Dragon 11, wind 190 at 10 knots, runway 23, cleared for take-off"*
<br>
Dragon 11: *"Cleared for take-off 23, Dragon 11"*

"Hold short" or less commonly, "hold" is a directive to stay where you are.

Dragon 11: *"Incirlik Tower, Dragon 11, take-off, VFR (to the North-East)"*
<br>
ATC: *"Dragon 11, hold short runway 23"*
<br>
Dragon 11: *"Hold short 23, Dragon 11"*

"Line-up and wait" or simply "line-up" is a directive for you to line up on the runway ONLY; it is not a clearance to take-off, and you must have take-off clearance before you begin your take-off roll.

Dragon 11: *"Incirlik Tower, Dragon 11, take-off, VFR (to the North-East)"*
<br>
ATC: *"Dragon 11, line-up and wait runway 23"*
<br>
Dragon 11: *"Dragon 11, line-up and wait 23"*

After you take-off, if there is a Departure Control at the airfield, Tower will tell you to switch to the departure frequency.

ATC: *"Dragon 11, change to Departure"*
<br>
Dragon 11: *"Dragon 11 switching"*

When you switch, check in with Departure as soon as practicable, as in the next section.

**Common Comms Crimes:** DickPilot: *"DickPilot, taking the active"*, *"DickPilot, rolling"*, *"DickPilot, on the runway"* Just... Don't. Please. In a formation, "rolling" or "brakes brakes brakes" is acceptable on intra-flight comms ONLY.

### Departure

Whenever making an initial check-in call while in a climb, you should acknowledge the altitude passing and the altitude cleared to by the previous controller (if applicable). This is also true when in a descent. If level, just state your altitude.

Dragon 11: *"Incirlik Departure, Dragon 11, passing 800 for 3000"*
<br>
ATC: *"Dragon 11, Incirlik Departure, radar contact"*

In the real world, different airfields have different procedures, depending on their class of airspace. For the purposes of VFR operations in DCS, it's perhaps most prudent to treat all airports in our operations as Class C. This means that you do NOT need ATC clearance to enter the airspace, and the only requirement is that you establish two-way radio contact with ATC.

Class C airspace in the real world is individually tailored for each specific airfield's flying environment, but generally in the US, it can be assumed to extend from the surface to 4000ft above the airfield's published field elevation, and with a two-tier radius (think upside-down wedding cake) of 5nm from the airfield for 0-1199ft and 10nm from 1200 - 4000ft.

In the real world, two-way radio contact is considered established when ATC responds to you with your callsign. This is a good general rule, but is not always practical in DCS. Use common sense here, and you'll be fine. If playing with live player ATC, please do what you can to respect their directives; the terminal area can get really hectic for controllers when there are multiple fast jets in the airspace, and they need to expend a lot of mental energy on maintaining SA and sequencing pilots. If you cannot follow an ATC directive, respond "Dragon 11, unable". You don't need to give a reason, but really try not to abuse that power.

/soapbox

All you need to do is whatever Departure Control directs you to do. Most likely, they'll give you a vector and a mode C transponder code; as always, read back all directives.

ATC: *"Dragon 11, squawk 4375, turn heading 290, maintain 3000"*
<br>
Dragon 11: *"4375, turn 290, maintain 3000, Dragon 11"*

In Class B and C airspace, report clear of the airspace:

Dragon 11: *"Incirlik Departure, Dragon 11, clear of class Charlie"*
<br>
ATC: *"Dragon 11, squawk VFR, frequency change approved"*
<br>
Dragon 11: *"Dragon 11, wilco"*

Once you hear "frequency change approved", you're clear to swap off the ATC frequency to whatever frequency you like.

### Approach and Recovery

These radio calls are a little bit more complicated, but like all radio calls with ATC, they follow the same general pattern - WHO you're talking to, WHO you are, WHERE you are, and WHAT you want. You should check the airfield's ATIS prior to making this call as well, to ensure you have the most recent information.

When approaching an airfield, **before reaching 10nm from the field**:

Dragon 11 (on approach): *"Incirlik Approach, Dragon 11 inbound, 12 miles South-East, 8500 with Kilo"*
<br>
ATC: *"Dragon 11, own navigation, report initials to Tower"*
<br>
Dragon 11: *"Initials to Tower, Dragon 11"*

If there is no Approach, you'll make the same call to Tower, instead.

Dragon 11: *"Incirlik Tower, Dragon 11, 12 miles South-East, 8500 with Kilo, full stop"*
<br>
ATC: *"Dragon 11, own navigation, report initials"*
<br>
Dragon 11: *"Dragon 11, wilco"*

What ATC replies with will depend on several factors; just do what they ask and don't overthink it. Remember, they have the big picture of the airspace; you don't. As always, if you cannot do what they direct, reply "unable".

Dragon 11: *"Dragon 11, unable"*

In the above examples, ATC directs you to "report initials". Initials means "initials for the break", though in the real world, this usage depends on several factors. For DCS purposes, we will consider "initials" to be a standard point 5nm from the field, between 1000 - 2000ft, offset laterally 1/4nm from the dead side of the active runway. Remember, you can always request what you want from ATC; you could request a straight in approach from 10 miles out if you really wanted to avoid this landing pattern stuff, but do note that the landing pattern exists because it's the most efficient way to handle a large amount of traffic.

Keeping with the above example, then, once you've reach the "initial" area:

Dragon 11: *"Incirlik Tower, Dragon 11, initials, full stop*
<br>
ATC: *"Dragon 11, Incirlik Tower, report the numbers runway 23"*
<br>
Dragon 11: *"Dragon 11, wilco"*

The next call is at the numbers (the approach end of the runway). This is fairly standard, and you'll likely hear this a lot with human ATC. Tower will identify any traffic in the landing pattern and clear you to break. The controller may clear you to break immediately (at the numbers), at midfield (halfway down the runway), at the upwind numbers (the opposite end of the active runway), or on the controller's command ("proceed upwind, I'll call your break"). If the controller doesn't specify, your break is to be timed at your own discretion. **This will be the most common case.**

Dragon 11: *"Dragon 11, numbers, 23"*
<br>
ATC: *"Dragon 11, right break approved"*
<br>
Dragon 11: *"Dragon 11, right break"*

When you approach the abeam position and your landing gear is down, report to the tower once more - remember, for final approach, you must include "gear down" or "three down and locked" (obviously after confirming that this is indeed true!) in radio call.

Dragon 11: *"Dragon 11, 180, gear down"*
<br>
ATC: *"Dragon 11, runway 23, cleared to land"*
<br>
Dragon 11: *"Cleared to land 23, Dragon 11"*

If you're unable to contact the tower at the assigned point dur to other radio calls, continue your approach, but amend your call by using your current position. Always remember to read back the tower's clearance!

Dragon 11: *"Dragon 11, 90, gear down"*
<br>
ATC: *"Dragon 11, runway 23, cleared option"*
<br>
Dragon 11: *"Cleared option 23, Dragon 11"*

### Taxi (Arrival)

On arrival, do not switch to the ground control frequency when you land. Active runways belong to Tower, and you **must** remain on tower's frequency until tower switches you to ground. If you have landed on the outboard runway of to parallel runways, tower will positively control your taxi off the runway, and provide instructions pertaining to the inboard runway.

ATC: *"Dragon 11, turn left when able, cross 23 Left, contact Ground when off"*
<br>
Dragon 11: *"Dragon 11, left when able, cross 23 Left, wilco"*

Contacting Ground is pretty straightforward. Remember, WHO, WHAT, WHERE:

Dragon 11: *"Incirlik Ground, Dragon 11, clear of the active, taxi to my line"*
<br>
ATC: *"Dragon 11, Incirlik Ground, taxi to your line via Charlie, Golf, Alpha"*
<br>
Dragon 11: *"Charle, Golf, Alpha to my line, Dragon 11"*

"My line" is your squadron's ramp. If you're away from home field, or at least at field where your squadron doesn't have a ramp, you can request a specific ramp, FBO, or the "transient ramp" as needed.

At larger airports, especially those with multiple runways, it may be advisable to tell Ground your location:

Dragon 11: *"Incirlik Ground, Dragon 11, clear of the active on Charlie, taxi to the transient line"*
<br>
ATC: *"Dragon 11, Incirlik Ground, taxi via Golf, left on Alpha, cross runway 05 at Alpha, left on Foxtrot to the transient line"*

That should be everything you need to know in order you need to communicate at towered airports!

### Non-Towered Airport Operations

DCS's built in ATC is a joke. Unless you have a player providing live ATC, all that stuff above doesn't really work, so instead, we modify our radio calls the same way real life pilots modify their radio calls when they fly to non-towered airfields. Note that this is not something that military aircraft actually do with any regularity, so we're going to be borrowing from general aviation.

Remember, at ALL airfields, but **especially** non-towered airfields, avoiding traffic is ultimately **YOUR** responsibility. The worst thing a pilot can do is to hit something with their airplane. Do what you can to build SA before you enter the vicinity of an airport, and make efforts to sequence yourself into the natural flow of traffic.

You make calls for the following:

- Taxiing
- Taking off
- Turning
- Landing
- Entering the area (10 miles)
- Departing the area

For non-towered airfields, you are talking to whatever the airfield's name is followed by "Traffic". Every radio call begins and ends with the name of the airfield. A quick flight, from the ramp, around a standard airport traffic pattern once, and then landing, would include the following radio calls:

Dragon 11: *"Incirlik Traffic, Dragon 11 taxiing to runway 23 via Alpha, Golf, Echo,  Incirlik"*
<br>
Dragon 11: *"Incirlik Traffic, Dragon 11 taking off runway 23, left closed traffic, Incirlik"*
<br>
Dragon 11: *"Incirlik Traffic, Dragon 11, turning left crosswind, runway 23, Incirlik"*
<br>
Dragon 11: *"Incirlik Traffic, Dragon 11, turning left downwind, runway 23, Incirlik"*
<br>
Dragon 11: *"Incirlik Traffic, Dragon 11, turning left base, runway 23, Incirlik"*
<br>
Dragon 11: *"Incirlik Traffic, Dragon 11, turning final, runway 23, Incirlik"*

You get the idea!

To approach a non-towered (or non-controlled) airfield, there's a pretty universal standard set of calls that follow the same pattern as above.

When you're about 10 miles out, announce where you are:

Dragon 11: "Incirlik Traffic, Dragon 11, 10 South-East at 3000, Incirlik"*

About 5 miles out for a standard traffic pattern or straight in approach, update your position, and announce your intentions:

Dragon 11: "Incirlik Traffic, Dragon 11, 5 South-East at 1500, will enter a left break for 23, Incirlik"*

When you're entering the airfield landing pattern, or have reached initials for your break:

Dragon 11: "Incirlik Traffic, Dragon 11, initials for 23, Incirlik"*

Remember, you're in charge of your airplane. You can make a straight in approach from 10 miles out if you want to, the most important thing is to clearly communicate your intentions and to avoid other air traffic.

#### A word about overhead breaks at non-towered airfields:

If you're approaching the airfield from the downwind initials (meaning the closest end of the runway to you is the active runway), make your break call at the upwind end of the runway, then one more call when you're 45 degrees past the touchdown point to turn final.

Dragon 11: *"Incirlik Traffic, Dragon 11, left break, full stop, Incirlik"*
<br>
Dragon 11: *"Incirlik Traffic, Dragon 11, final, gear down, Incirlik"*

If you're approaching the airport from the upwind side (opposite side of the active runway), proceed instead directly into the downwind leg from initials, with the same call at 45 degrees past the touchdown point.

Dragon 11: *"Incirlik Traffic, Dragon 11, downwind, full stop, Incirlik"*
<br>
Dragon 11: *"Incirlik Traffic, Dragon 11, final, gear down, Incirlik"*

Remember, initials is a point 5nm from the field, offset from the runway by 1/4nm, and between 1000 and 2000ft AGL.
